        If you've marveled at Google Photos identifying your friends or autonomous cars navigating complex environments, you've witnessed the power of Computer Vision in action.
      </p>

      <h2>How Does Computer Vision Work?</h2>
      <p>The process of Computer Vision involves several key stages:</p>

      <h3>1. Image Acquisition</h3>
      <p>
        Capturing digital images or video data using cameras, sensors, or other input devices.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Image Processing</h3>
      <p>
        Preprocessing the image to enhance quality, remove noise, or standardize input for analysis.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Feature Extraction</h3>
      <p>
        Identifying key attributes in the image, such as edges, shapes, textures, or objects.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Understanding and Decision-Making</h3>
      <p>
        Machine learning models are used to analyze extracted features and provide actionable insights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Computer Vision relies heavily on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a specialized form of deep learning designed to efficiently recognize visual patterns.
