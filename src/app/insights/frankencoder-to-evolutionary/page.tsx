      {/* Introduction */}
      <p className="lead text-xl text-gray-300 mb-8">
        Technology plays Darwin's role in the grand theater of human progress, relentlessly shaping us to evolve or perish. The rise of AI-powered coding tools like Cursor has opened the gates for non-coders to leap into application development. But just as evolution is fraught with challenges, so is the journey of these brave "Frankencoders" as they wrestle with freezing AIs, looping commands, and the very boundaries of their understanding.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8">
        Let's explore how you can go from a floundering "Frankencoder" to a thriving code evolutionary, turning Cursor AI into your ally instead of your Frankenstein.
      </p>

      {/* First Section */}
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-6">The 70% Problem and the Art of Adaptation</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        There's an unspoken truth in coding: tools like Cursor can get you 70% of the way there, but the remaining 30%? That's where your creativity and grit come in. For the non-coder, this 30% is where the real battle begins. Cursor AI may write code like a seasoned developer, but its Achilles heel lies in two significant frustrations: freezing up due to complex histories and getting stuck in loops when it can't quite read your mind.
      </p>

      {/* The Freeze Section */}
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-6">The Freeze: When Cursor Becomes a Popsicle</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        You're working on your app, flying through your tasks, and then… Cursor freezes. Why? Large histories. Cursor's mind gets cluttered, overwhelmed by the sheer scale of what you're asking it to process. But here's a Darwinian truth: survival requires simplicity.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-cyan-300 mb-4">Here's how you can unclog Cursor's mental pipes:</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-4">
        <li>
          <strong className="text-primary">Copy Your Code to a New Folder:</strong>
          <p className="mt-2">Think of this as hitting "reset" on Cursor's memory. Move your existing codebase into a new, pristine folder.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-primary">Point Cursor to the New Environment:</strong>
          <p className="mt-2">Tell Cursor, "Hey, forget the old chaos, let's work here now." This clears the slate for a fresh start.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong className="text-primary">Rebuild Its World Gradually:</strong>
          <p className="mt-2">Start small. Reintroduce essential parts of your project, one piece at a time. Show Cursor the project's structure without overwhelming it.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      {/* The Loop Section */}
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-6">The Loop: When Cursor Loses the Plot</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Ever had Cursor spiral into a feedback loop, churning out the same nonsensical code or refusing to understand what you mean? That's Cursor throwing its hands up and saying, "I don't get it." But there's a simple trick: comments.
      </p>

      {/* Pro Tips Section */}
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-6">Pro Tips for Evolving Beyond Frankencoder Status</h2>
      <div className="grid gap-6 mb-8">
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-cyan-300 mb-2">Update, Update, Update:</h3>
          <p>AI tools are like living organisms; they adapt and improve over time. Keep Cursor and all related software updated to benefit from bug fixes and performance enhancements.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-cyan-300 mb-2">Monitor System Resources:</h3>
          <p>Cursor doesn't exist in a vacuum—it shares your computer with other processes. Close unnecessary applications to ensure Cursor has enough resources to perform efficiently.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-cyan-300 mb-2">Lean on the Tribe:</h3>
          <p>Evolution isn't a solo endeavor. Join user communities and forums to learn tips, share frustrations, and discover hacks you never knew existed.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* Conclusion */}
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-6">Embrace the Evolutionary Journey</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        The beauty of tools like Cursor isn't that they make coding effortless—it's that they open the door to learning by doing. You don't need to be an expert coder to build something extraordinary. But you do need to acknowledge that Cursor is just a tool, not a magic wand.
